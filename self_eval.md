# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - I feel confident on using built-in methods, and if needed, looking up how to use them if I struggle.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - I feel pretty confident about building methods for now. My only concern is learning how to organize and use them and other variables in a greater scope in a larger project.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - Can you redefine a method after it has already been declared?
    - In Ruby, can you call on a method in your code if it is declared in the lines after it?
